# Proof of Latency
Proof of Latency is an algorithm/protocol that creates a publicly verifiable proof of latency between two peers by using two VDFs.

## Prerequisites
Currently requires Linux to run with GNU Multiple Precision Library.

To install it on Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libgmp-dev
```

...or on Red Hat based distros, such as Arch, Fedora, CentOS:
```bash
sudo dnf -y install gmp-devel
```

...and you should be good to go!
